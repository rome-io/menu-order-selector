# menu-order-selector
A python script for viewing a menu, size, prices, and selecting an item from the menu.
The code features a menu for a fictional ice cream shop, with a selection of seven flavors, three different sized with different prices, and a prompt for ordering. Error messages are incorporated with prompts for the patron to re-submit their selection as necessary. A final message is provided to summarize the order and cost of the order to the patron. 
This python script was written by myself from scratch and is one of my first python projects. It will not be revisited for any fine-tuning.
